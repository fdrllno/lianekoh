            <p>Everyday has felt like a dream when I'm with you sweetie - a dream I never want to end. As I could never imagine myself living the rest of my life without you by my side.</p>
            <p>Cause whether we're just lying around somewhere, watching your fav shows/podcasts, commuting through qc or manila, sitting together in class; </p>
            <p>eating sisig at teresa, being all cuddly and cozy inside the LRT train, fucking in those spring or winter hotels HAHA, or being all competitive when playing together; </p>
            <p>all those small moments and many others, looking back at it - I can't help but just laugh, smile and maybe even cry. As you've been an unexpected addition to my life sweetie, </p>
            <p>Who now has become the most important person in my life right now, in which every moment i spend with you has been the happiest moments in my life.</p>
            <p>One of these days, I might just write a book of all my feelings for you - but still that wouldn't be enough, not even multiple editions could never truly express...</p>
            <p>never truly express the love I have for you my darling. You're the love of my life, my lifeline, my wife, my lobster, my everything, you're my liane.</p>
            <p>and for I am yours s you are mine, I will continue to love you so, in this lifeitme and in all the next ones - my soul is too entangled to your sweetie;</p>
            <p>it'll always be you, I will always choose to love you - it would never be someone else as there is only one Jessa Liane Coca Manrique in this whole universe</p>
            <p>Our 8 months will soon turn to a year, and would later become decades and maybe even a century with each other. One things for sure, I can't wait to spend my whole life with you my love.</p>
            <p>I love you. I LOVE YOU I LOVE YOU I LOVE YOU I LOVE YOU, I'll give you all the kissy kisses and all the hugs I could ever give. to you and only to you my sweet babie, Happy 8th Monthsary my magnolia. </p>
